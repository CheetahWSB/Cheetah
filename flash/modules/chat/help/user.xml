		<contents><![CDATA[We respect your desire to keep some dialogues/conversations secret. Therefore, if you do not wish to take part in common/public chat, and would like to have a separate conversation (where you probably will share your contact data, real name etc. ) with some of the online chat users, you have to invite this chat user to a <a href="event:privateChat"><FONT COLOR="#333399"><B><U>Private Chat</U></B></FONT></a> or you can create one that is "<a href="event:rooms"><FONT COLOR="#333399"><B>Password Protected</B></FONT></a>". All messages sent by users of a chat in the protected room or in private chat - are available  to the user whom you have chosen for a private chat or to users whom you have provided with the password from your room only (if they are present in the room). To all other chat users, these dialogues are not visible. ]]></contents>
