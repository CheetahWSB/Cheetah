Automatic part of upgrade is completed. Please do the following to complete upgrade
process:<br><br><strong>The Paypal Payflow module has been removed</strong> from the main Cheetah
Distrubution. It will eventually be replaced with Paypal subscriptions that will
be built into the standard Payment module.<br>So you should remove the module if
you are not currently using it. To remove the module, <strong>make sure it is
uninstalled</strong> and then delete the folder <strong>
modules\cheetah\paypal_payflow<br></strong>If your currently using it, you can
wait until subscriptions become available in the standard Payment module before
removing it.<br><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Because the Paypal Payflow module has been removed from Cheetah, it will no longer be upgraded, maintained or any bugs fixed from here on.
