<br> Automatic part of upgrade is completed. Please do the following to complete upgrade process:
<br>
<br><strong>The Paypal Payflow module has been removed</strong> from the main Cheetah
Distribution. It will eventually be replaced with PayPal subscriptions that will be built into the standard Payment module. So you should remove the module if you are not currently using it.
<br>
<br>To remove the module, <strong>make sure
it is uninstalled</strong> and then delete the folder <strong>modules\cheetah\paypal_payflow<br>
<br></strong>If your currently using it, you can wait until subscriptions become available in the standard Payment module before removing it.
<br>
<br><strong>Note:</strong> Because the PayPal Payflow module has been removed from Cheetah, it will no longer be upgraded, maintained or any bugs fixed from here on.
<br>
<br>

<br><strong>The
Messenger module has been removed</strong> from the main Cheetah Distribution. It will eventually be replaced with a html5 version. The module is flash based and all flash based modules will eventually be removed from Cheetah. So you should remove the module if you are not currently using it.
<br>
<br>To remove the module, <strong>make sure it is uninstalled</strong> and then delete the folder <strong>
modules\cheetah\messenger<br><br></strong>If your currently using it, you can wait until a new replacement has been created. However, given that the messenger module is flash based, it is not likely to work after December 31, 2020 as that is when web browsers will begin removing flash support.<strong><br><br>Note:</strong> Because the Messenger module has been removed from Cheetah, it will no longer be upgraded, maintained or any bugs fixed from here on.

<br><strong>The

<br><strong>The
Russian language module has been removed</strong> from the main Cheetah
Distribution. It was and could be included in Dolphin because boonex had
employees that spoke Russian and therefor could properly maintain it.<br>I
however do not speak any Russian. Thus i cannot properly maintain accurate
translations for this module so it should be removed until a replacement is
provided in the market by a 3'rd party vendor.<br>
<br>To remove the module, <strong>make sure it is uninstalled</strong> and then delete the folder <strong>
modules\cheetah\russian<br><br></strong> You should also remove the following
forum language files.<br><br><strong>modules\cheetah\forum\install\langs\ru.php<br>
modules\cheetah\forum\integrations\base\langs\ru.php</strong><br> <strong>
<br>Note:</strong> Because the Russian
language module has been removed from Cheetah, it will no longer be upgraded, maintained or any bugs fixed from here on.

<br>This version of Cheetah now provides both Linux and Windows versions of
ffmpeg. This version also includes ffprobe which is used to get information on
uploaded files to determine if conversion is even needed. This is done to
prevent unneeded conversions so uploaded files become available for playback
much quicker.<br><br>Also to prepare for the eventual full removal of flash,
ffmpeg and ffprobe are located in the plugins folder rather than the flash
folder, so you will need to set execute permission on these files manually.<br>
<br>Set permissions to executable on the following files. chmod 777<br><br>
plugins/ffmpeg/ffmpeg<br>plugins/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.exe<br>plugins/ffmpeg/ffprobe<br>
plugins/ffmpeg/ffprobe.exe<br>
<br>
