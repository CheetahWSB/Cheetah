<br> Automatic part of upgrade is completed. Please do the following to complete upgrade process:<br>
<br>
Edit inc/header.inc.php and loo for this.<br><br>define('CH_WSB_SPLASH_VIS_ALL',
'all');<br><br>Add this directly under it. <br><br>define('CH_WSB_CSS_JS_VER',
'1');<br><br>In the future when you make changes to CSS and JS files and need
force browsers to fetch a new copy of the files rather than use it's cached
copy, you can just increment the 1 after CH_WSB_CSS_JS_VER<br>That change will
cause web browsers that regularly visit you site to reload the files. Increment
that number only when necessary.<br><br>
<hr>
<br>The module Chat which is flash based has been removed. NOTE: Do not confuse
it with the Chat+ module, they are not the same. You will need to remove this
module from any current installs. To remove it, make sure it is uninstalled and
then delete the folder modules\cheetah\chat<br><br>Because the Chat module has
been removed from the main Cheetah distribution, there will no longer be any
updates to this module.<br><br>
